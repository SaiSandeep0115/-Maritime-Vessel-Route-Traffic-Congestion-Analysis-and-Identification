### Abstract: 
This project focuses on analyzing vessel traffic congestion in maritime routes by utilizing AIS data sourced from MarineTraffic. By applying clustering techniques, we aim to identify congested areas and provide insights for improving traffic flow and operational efficiency.

### Dataset Source: 
MarineTraffic

### Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the AIS dataset for analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Clustering Analysis: Employed DBSCAN clustering to identify patterns and congested zones within vessel traffic.
Data Visualization: Utilized Tableau to create visual representations of traffic congestion, facilitating easy interpretation of the results.

### Models: 
The DBSCAN algorithm was implemented to cluster vessel traffic data, allowing for the identification of high-density areas that indicate congestion. The results were visualized using Tableau to enhance understanding and communicate findings effectively.

### Results and Conclusion: 
The analysis revealed key congestion hotspots within maritime routes, providing valuable insights for stakeholders to improve traffic management and enhance operational efficiency.

### Disclaimer: 
The findings from this project may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Further validation and refinement are necessary to ensure reliability and effectiveness in practical applications.
